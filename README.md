**[Device Manager](https://device-manager.github.io/)**, which could be defined as a Control Panel that's an extension of the Microsoft Management Console, provides users an organized, central view of the Windows-recognized hardware attached to a computer. This includes devices like keyboards, hard disk drives, USB devices, etc. It sorts out all hardware, listing them on the basis of various criteria and when a device malfunctions or stops working altogether, it immediately notifies the user. Thus it can be used to control devices, enable or disable them, configure them, identify conflicts between devices, and much more.

## How to Use Device Manager?

Like what's shown in the example image above, **[Device Manager](https://device-manager.github.io/)** lists devices in separate categories so that it's easier to find what you're looking for. You can expand each section to see which devices are listed inside. Once you find the right hardware device, double-click it to see more information like its current status, driver details, or in some cases its power management options.

Some of these categories include Audio inputs and outputs, Disk drives, Display adapters, DVD/CD-ROM drives, Printers, Sound, video and game controllers, and Universal Serial Bus controllers.

If you were having troubles with your network card, you might open the Network adapters area and see if there are any unusual icons or colors associated with the device in question. You can double-click it if you want more information about it or to perform one of the tasks listed below.

Each device listing contains a detailed driver, system resource, and other configuration information and settings. When you change a setting for a piece of hardware, it changes the way Windows works with that hardware.
